usage: baudio FILE {-o OUTFILE} OPTIONS

  Play a javascript music FILE. FILE should export a method signature of:

    return function (t) {
        return Math.sin(2 * Math.PI * t * 441);
    };
  
  where the return value is between -1 and 1, inclusive. Values outside of the
  domain -1 through 1 will be clipped.
  
  If -o is given, output will be written to OUTFILE instead. OUTFILE can be any
  media file that sox supports for output: .mp3, .wav, .ogg, whatever.
  
  You can also use "-" for -o to write to stdout.

  Extra OPTIONS include:

    -d, --duration   How long the song should play as a human-parseable string.

    -t, --offset     Jump to this time offset as a human-parseable string.

    -f, --fade       Length of a trailing fade as a human-parseable string.
 
    -r, --rate       Bitrate to use. Default: 44k.
 
  Example usage:

    Play a song:

      baudio beepboop.js

    Play a song for 30 seconds:

      baudio beepboop.js -d 30s
